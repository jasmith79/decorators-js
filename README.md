# decorators-js
Common javascript decorators I use. You'll note some omissions like `memoize`, `curry`, etc. I use the
[Ramda](http://ramdajs.com/0.18.0/index.html) library quite frequently and did not feel the need to
duplicate their excellent work (although the module does not *depend* on Ramda, I manually curried
the relevant functions).
